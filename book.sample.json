    "overview": "The Enchanted Forest is a fantasy novel set in the mystical realm of Eldoria, a land filled with ancient magic, hidden dangers, and mythical creatures. The story follows Elara, a young herbalist with a mysterious past, as she embarks on a quest to save her village from a creeping darkness that threatens to consume the forest. Along the way, she encounters allies like Thalion, a rogue elf with a sharp wit, and Korrak, a gruff dwarf with a heart of gold, as well as enemies such as the Shadow Wraith, a malevolent force tied to the darkness. Key plot devices include the Amulet of Light, a powerful artifact that can banish the darkness, and the Prophecy of the Chosen, which hints at Elara's true destiny. The narrative explores themes of courage, sacrifice, and the balance between light and shadow, with pivotal moments like the betrayal at Raven's Hollow and the final confrontation at the Heart of the Forest. The world of Eldoria is rich with lore, including ancient wars between the Fae and the Shadowkin, which provide critical background for the current conflict.",

    "instructions": {
        "edit": "When editing, maintain a whimsical yet slightly ominous tone to reflect the magical but dangerous nature of Eldoria. Use vivid, sensory language to describe the forest and its creatures. Avoid modern slang or colloquialisms; instead, use archaic or formal phrasing where appropriate to enhance the fantasy setting. Replace overly common words like 'said' with alternatives like 'murmured,' 'whispered,' or 'proclaimed' to add variety to dialogue tags.",
        "audio": "For the audio narration, adopt a slow, deliberate pace to build suspense and allow listeners to immerse themselves in the world. Use a warm, storytelling tone for Elara's perspective, with slight variations for other charactersâ€”Thalion should have a sly, melodic edge to his voice, while Korrak should sound gruff and grounded. Emphasize dramatic pauses during tense moments to heighten the emotional impact."
